summary of differences between AM & PS resume analyzers - 01/28/2000

in terms of the analyzer.seq, the only things different are your height.pat (which has nothing in it?)
and weak0.  And weak_boundaries.pat is slightly different, as we talked about this morning.
gee, not so far out of synch afterall... also, that nonsense with degree being a . happened because
of an overlap in text examples in degree and degreephrase.  

in terms of files, here's the summary:

your addressline and addresspart are different, but i can't
just swipe yours because they're from samples.

mine has a thick cityphrase due to the large list file.

you've added some stuff to conf_geo, so i've adopted that

my countryphrase is now minus places which are both countries
and cities, and those terms are in ambiguousTerms.pat

i added some stuff to degree1.pat, and edu1 is a little diff,
i need to inbestigate this

i have some additional headerPhrases

you have added jobtitle to experiencepart, i guess with samples

i have added a large field name file

humanname has some slight diffs, which i'll adopt

i tweaked g_addr to handle some 'stralian constructs

minor change to g_caps0 is adopted

got your fix in grade0

as far as humanname.pat, it appears from the rules file that the
number of samples is too small to afford any generalization.  ideas?

i have added some real job titles to the sample hierarchy so jobtitle is diff

looks like you've got another extension pattern in phoneextension,
which i'll need to find

your phonenumber pattern is more complex, so i'll need those samples too
(guess i'll convert these cases to samples files & reload)

your posprep has a lot more samples

i added NSW to the list of states

you sampled an extra term in resumeword

you made a small extra tweak to z_conf

i added tweaks to z_context

you tweaked z_format
